During this technical test, I utilized three key libraries: Retrofit2, RxJava3, and Jetpack. By incorporating RxJava3, I effectively handled asynchronous operations, preventing the main thread from being blocked by lengthy tasks. This library also facilitated frequent event-based operations, aligning well with the functional programming style in Kotlin.

Retrofit proved invaluable due to its straightforward API configuration and seamless integration with RxJava. Additionally, its extensibility allowed for easy implementation of user account tokens or security certificates, if required.

To synchronize with the Android lifecycle and streamline code-to-XML transitions, I leveraged Jetpack. Its integration aided in reducing development time, ensuring smooth navigation between different application states.
